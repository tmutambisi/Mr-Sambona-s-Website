And education is the only way toward that vision!\nOne of the founding provisions of Zimbabwe as outlined in the Constitution is the recognition of the equality of all human beings and gender equality.\nA people not ready to defend their founding values deserve a master. It is only through education that people attain and safeguards their freedoms, but it is through ignorance that we become slaves of the masters of poverty, tyranny, drugs and substance abuse as well as gender-based violence.\nWe say no to be slaves in our nation, but we say yes to education. The only weapon to defend our freedom and future.\nIt is by education that we create a new set of leaders of this generation who will heed the call of the Prophet Isaiah, to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free.\nIt is only through education that we make gender equality and women's emancipation the first order of business and the first legislative agenda.\nOur Government inherited a racially biased education system at Independence in 1980. A system that offered fewer and lower quality educational opportunities for the majority of the citizenry; especially school dropouts, young adults, and women.\nEven though provisions such as the non-formal education policy and adult literacy programmes such as ZABEC have been made to make quality education accessible to all, challenges continue to exist still within our system.\nChallenges such as drug and substance abuse, teenage pregnancies, early marriages, and even cases of violence among students not only themselves, and also with teachers.\nFortunately, these are challenges that collectively we can solve. But first, will you join me in that historic quest for educational transformation and modernisation to meet these common enemies of mankind against human progress?\nMy humble solution to all this can be put into a motto: 'Let's Go Smart and do it now!' If only we could open our education system up to technology and the use of mobile devices in our learning institutions, maybe we can hit the right balance between the past and the present.\nAnd in that revolutionary step transform our education system into a system better designed for the future.\nWill you, take that step with me in making education more digital and smart? And together we can bring the future into the present.",

    "content": "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child has the right to education, emphasizing the need to learn about human rights and respect for diverse cultures.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the Education Act of 1987 reinforces this framework, making it a punishable offense for parents to deny their children the opportunity to learn.\n\nTragically, the harsh reality of child pregnancies looms large. In 2022, a nine-year-old girl from Tsholotsho District was impregnated by an adult man, who was later arrested. Thankfully, the child survived and gave birth, but such incidents rob children of their innocence and the right to simply be children.\n\nThis raises a critical question: how can we defend the girl child's right to education as enshrined in Section 75 of Zimbabwe's Constitution?\n\nInvesting in girls' education is one of the most effective ways to combat poverty. The World's Children's Prize Magazine asserts that when girls are educated, they tend to marry later and have fewer, healthier children. Basic education empowers them to demand respect for their rights, with every additional year of schooling increasing a girl's future salary by up to 20 percent.\n\nYet, many parents still believe that investing in their daughters' education is futile, as they will eventually marry into another family. Of the 125 million children worldwide who do not attend school, 75 million are girls.\n\nZimbabwe has made strides in advancing the rights of the girl child. The Marriages Act, signed into law in 2022, prohibits the marriage of minors under 18. This was a significant victory; however, schools still grapple with issues of early pregnancies, sexual abuse, and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. These challenges divert girls from their studies and lead to declining academic performance. Many eventually drop out, increasing their vulnerability to abuse at home.\n\nMwanasikana, remember that knowledge is power. Without education, you risk becoming a victim of those who see you only as a potential wife or a means of fulfilling their desires.\n\nIt is disheartening to hear schoolgirls express a desire to marry instead of pursuing their education. What happened to the hunger for freedom and knowledge? Marriage is not the ultimate goal; it is merely one part of life. Beyond marriage lies liberty, literacy, and empowerment. Education is not just important; it is essential. It remains the key to eradicating gender-based violence and overcoming ignorance.\n\nEducation is a powerful tool for achieving total emancipation and tackling poverty. Globally, 1.4 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, with 70 percent of them being women and girls. This statistic underscores the urgency of education as a pathway to empowerment.\n\nMwanasikana, education is your inherent right. Any discrimination against your access to quality education is not only unlawful but also a violation of fundamental human rights.\n\nNow is the time.\n\nRonald Takudzwa Sambona is an A-Level student at St John's Chikwaka Secondary School",

    "content": "It's normal during the festive season to empty your pockets and savings on something special for the family. For Christians, Christmas holds deep significance—a time to show love through gifts. But parents, the greatest gift you can offer your little girls is the opportunity to learn.\n\nStatistics reveal that many girls come to school late, often two or three weeks after schools open. As you consider all the ways to spoil your children, remember: the best gift you can give her is an education.\n\nNobel laureate and former president Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela said, \n> 'A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination, but add to that a literate tongue, then you have something special indeed.'\n\nEducation is not only special, but essential for empowering girls. Once a girl is educated, she can use her knowledge and skills to improve her life for the better—and this education lasts a lifetime!\n\nThat's why the greatest gift you can offer is a high-quality education. It starts by making her education a top priority in your family budget, just as local councils and governments ensure educational needs are met by design, not by chance.\n\nSustainable Development Goal 5 of the United Nations, focused on achieving gender equality, emphasizes that parents can take the right measures to promote equality starting from home. Remember to save money for her education this festive season.\n\nI understand that with all the fun, demands, and pressures of the holidays, it's easy to forget our priorities. But let's keep our commitment to girls' education alive!\n\nThe African region ranks lowest in literacy rates among the ten regions of the world. With a literacy rate of only 62.4 percent, African women also have the highest fertility rate, with a single woman bearing about 4.8 children in her lifetime.\n\nSadly, the less educated our girls are, the more likely they are to be treated as baby-making machines by male sexual predators. Men will always treat women the way they perceive them. To achieve gender equality, as enshrined in Section 3 of our Zimbabwean Constitution, we must stimulate social consciousness.\n\nIt's every citizen's responsibility to educate society on the importance of girls' education. Women who have achieved academic success also have a responsibility to let the younger generation of girls know they can do it too!\n\nOnce our little girls are socially conscious and understand that they must be educated just like boys, we'll be halfway toward establishing gender equality. This festive season and every other season, let's choose to be part of the solution against women's abuse and gender-based violence, rather than the problem.\n\nAll it really takes to uplift a girl child is you and me, working together in solidarity and unity of purpose, guided by our founding values and principles.\n\nDemocracy functions best when all members of a nation are equally emancipated.\n\nAfter all the fancy gifts have been used up and forgotten, the gift of education will endure—and ultimately last a girl's whole lifetime.\n\nSo parents, let's give her an education—the gift of a lifetime!",

    "content": "Zimbabwe is ranked as one of the top countries in Africa with a large percentage of citizens who are adequately educated. Many developed countries around the world don't even come close when it comes to education.\n\nAll great statesmen in world history have understood the deep importance of education, and as a nation, we should realize the power we hold. It is a popular cliché that 'without knowledge, a people perish.' In the same vein, we can say that without education, a nation collapses.\n\nPerhaps the real reason why a vast majority of marginalized groups—such as women, the poor, and those living with disabilities—still languish in the dark corners of poverty is because of education and how it is structured.\n\nYes, we are recognized for our education, but are we recognized for our equity, equality, and social justice within the education sector? We remain burdened by vast problems that are representative of an illiterate people and a struggling economy. If we are to capitalize on education and fuel economic growth and social cohesion, our education must be reformed.\n\nReformed how?\nOur education must be able to reach people from all corners of society and positively influence their lives. It is at this meeting point—where quality education and positive social change intersect—that our education system can become a beacon for the rest of Africa and the world.\n\nDespite our so-called quality education, Zimbabwe continues to grapple with challenges such as domestic violence, intimate partner violence, high substance abuse among youths, corruption, inequality, and unemployment.\n\nIn a debt-ridden economy, education that is not only of high quality but also accessible and affordable to everyone becomes the starting point for greater things ahead for our Zimbabwean people.\n\nHow do we propel our education system in the right direction for our nation's future?\nIt starts with infusing integrity, equality, and an undying spirit into our education system—a spirit that operates on the knowledge that all human beings are fundamentally equal and have access to the same basic rights as declared by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nWe must fight for a spirit in our education system that abides by the principles of our liberal Constitution. A spirit that yields to the truth that Zimbabwe is founded on the respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms, and entrenches gender equality in all its dimensions.\n\nEducation remains a pivotal cornerstone of the struggle.\nEducation for all in our lifetime! Education for justice! Education now!",
